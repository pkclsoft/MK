MK Command Description----------------------'MK' takes a file of dependencies (a 'makefile') and decides what commandshave to be executed to bring the files up to date. Syntax:   make [-v[ersion]] [-a[ll]] [-e[xecute]] [-noe[xecute]] [-c[ommandfile] filename]           [-i[gnore]] [-noi[gnore]] [-t[arget] targetname] [-l[ist]] [filename] [-d]         [-o pipeName] [makefilename]    -version        Display version information.    -all            Force MK to 'build' all targets.  All targets are built                    regardless of whether the time/date information requires                    it.    -execute        Execute build commands.  Any commands that MK decides must                    be executed, will be executed.  This switch is on by                    default.  It is advised that you specify this switch in                    any case when ever you require this function, as in the                    future the default setting may change.     -noexecute      Negates the -execute switch.  Prevents any build commands                    from being executed.    -commandfile    All commands are written to the specified file, and not                    executed.  Note that this switch negates the -execute                    switch.    -ignore         Normally, MK will abort a build whenever an error occurs,                    however by using this switch you may ask MK to ignore any                    errors that occur as a result of a NON-COMPILE command.                     Currently, MK recognises a command containing any of the                    following strings as a compile command:                    COMPILE     CMPL        CMPLG       ASSEMBLE    ASML                    ASMLG       ASM                    By default, this switch is set to on, and may only be                    turned off by the -noignore switch.  It is advised that                    you specify this switch in any case when ever you require                    this function, as in the future the default setting may                    change.     -noignore       Turns off the function invoked by the -ignore switch.    -target         Asks MK to 'MAKE' the specified target.  Note that the                    target name is case sensitive.  This switch may be used                    repetitively on the command line.     -list           This switch must be used in conjunction with the -target                    switch.  It asks MK to produce a dependency list for each                    of the targets specified using the -target switch.     -d  			Causes MK to output a bunch of debug information as it does    				it's work.    -o 				Tells MK to pipe all output to the specified file.    filename        This parameter names the file from which MK reads the                    target list and the dependencies.  If no value is given to                    this parameter, then MK will look for the file MAKEFILE in                    the current directory.  ------------------------------======***======------------------------------MK MakeFile Description-----------------------The 'MakeFile' contains a list of dependencies.  Each dependency has xxxxparts, as follows:    Target      The target is the name of a file that is to be the result of                one or more commands.  A target has one or more depencencies                or sources.     Source      The source is a file that is associated with a target in that                whenever MK finds a Source with a time/date stamp that is                later than the Target, MK will flag that target as one to be                built.     Commands    When MK decides to build a target, it executes one or more                commands that are specified as a part of the dependency.                 Commands can cross line boundaries.  This is done by                placing a hyphen (-) character at the end of a line.  By                doing this MK will concatenate the contents of the next                line to the command that was broken. The syntax of a Dependency is as follows:Target Source1 [Source1...SourceN] [= Single Command]|[{ Several Commands }]For example, the following dependencies form some of the MAKEFILE for MK itself:      ! A make file to make MK.	obj/mk		obj/mk.a {				link obj/mk obj/ezconst obj/ezmisc obj/ezdates obj/ezstring obj/ezasm keep=obj/mk			   }	obj/ezasm.a	  asm/ezasm.asm		{ assemble asm/ezasm.asm		  move -C ezasm.a obj		  move -C ezasm.root obj		}The dependencies may be in any order, as MK reads them all in before doing anytime/date checking.Before processing any line of text in the MAKEFILE, MK will trim anyleading or trailing spaces from the line, and convert any TAB characters tospaces. Comments may be placed in the MAKEFILE at any time, simply be preceding thecommand with an Exclamation mark (!).  ------------------------------======***======------------------------------
