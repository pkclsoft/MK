MK Command Description
----------------------

'MK' takes a file of dependencies (a 'makefile') and decides what commands
have to be executed to bring the files up to date. 

Syntax:
    make [-version] [-all] [-execute] [-noexecute] [-commandfile filename]
         [-ignore] [-noignore] [-target targetname] [-list] [filename]

    -version        Display version information.

    -all            Force MK to 'build' all targets.  All targets are built
                    regardless of whether the time/date information requires
                    it.

    -execute        Execute build commands.  Any commands that MK decides must
                    be executed, will be executed.  This switch is on by
                    default.  It is advised that you specify this switch in
                    any case when ever you require this function, as in the
                    future the default setting may change. 

    -noexecute      Negates the -execute switch.  Prevents any build commands
                    from being executed.

    -commandfile    All commands are written to the specified file, and not
                    executed.  Note that this switch negates the -execute
                    switch.

    -ignore         Normally, MK will abort a build whenever an error occurs,
                    however by using this switch you may ask MK to ignore any
                    errors that occur as a result of a NON-COMPILE command. 
                    Currently, MK recognises a command containing any of the
                    following strings as a compile command:

                    COMPILE     CMPL        CMPLG       ASSEMBLE    ASML
                    ASMLG       ASM

                    By default, this switch is set to on, and may only be
                    turned off by the -noignore switch.  It is advised that
                    you specify this switch in any case when ever you require
                    this function, as in the future the default setting may
                    change. 

    -noignore       Turns off the function invoked by the -ignore switch.

    -target         Asks MK to 'MAKE' the specified target.  Note that the
                    target name is case sensitive.  This switch may be used
                    repetitively on the command line. 

    -list           This switch must be used in conjunction with the -target
                    switch.  It asks MK to produce a dependency list for each
                    of the targets specified using the -target switch. 

    filename        This parameter names the file from which MK reads the
                    target list and the dependencies.  If no value is given to
                    this parameter, then MK will look for the file MAKEFILE in
                    the current directory.

MK MakeFile Description
-----------------------

The 'MakeFile' contains a list of dependencies.  Each dependency has xxxx
parts, as follows:

    Target      The target is the name of a file that is to be the result of
                one or more commands.  A target has one or more depencencies
                or sources. 

    Source      The source is a file that is associated with a target in that
                whenever MK finds a Source with a time/date stamp that is
                later than the Target, MK will flag that target as one to be
                built. 

    Commands    When MK decides to build a target, it executes one or more
                commands that are specified as a part of the dependency. 
                Commands can cross line boundaries.  This is done by
                placing a hyphen (-) character at the end of a line.  By
                doing this MK will concatenate the contents of the next
                line to the command that was broken. 

The syntax of a Dependency is as follows:

Target Source1 [Source1...SourceN] [= Single Command]|[{ Several Commands }]

For example, the following three dependencies form the MAKEFILE for MK itself.

mk                                  ! Make the executable.
    mk.obj
    { linkiigs -t exe -o mk mk.obj -
               -lib 2/ezlib -lib 2/paslib -lib 2/syslib
      catalog}

mk.obj mk.a = crunchiigs mk         ! Make the .OBJ file for LinkIIGS.

mk.a mk.pas { compile mk.pas }      ! Produce the .ROOT and .A files.

The dependencies may be in any order, as MK reads them all in before doing any
time/date checking.

Before processing any line of text in the MAKEFILE, MK will trim any
leading or trailing spaces from the line, and convert any TAB characters to
spaces. 

Comments may be placed in the MAKEFILE at any time, simply be preceding the
command with an Exclamation mark (!).


IMPORTANT:

    Target and Source names are CASE SENSITIVE! If you mix case in one
    declaration of a target or source, then you must use the same mixture
    of case in all other occurences of the target/source name. 

    If you make an error in this regard then the results will be
    unpredictable, excepting that the program will not crash.
